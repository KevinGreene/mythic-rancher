# Rules

## Object

The object of the game is to have the most victory points at the end.

The fun object of the game is to have demonstrated your superior ability to ranch King Harlaus's magical creatures

## Game Setup

Deal a random Player Card to each player. This represents their rancher. On this card is a special ability - make sure to familiarize yourself with everyone's abilities before play.

Choose a Master Rancher (starting player).

Shuffle the creature deck, and place it near the play area.

## Round Setup

At the beginning of each round, draw 4 cards from the deck for each player. Arrange them in a way such that everyone can see.

Starting with the Master Rancher, players take turns selecting a face up creature to care for this round. After everyone has selected one creature, starting with the last player they draft in counter-clockwise order. Then clockwise again, then counterclockwise.

## Turns

Each player roles 4 dice, and puts all dice in the middle

Starting with the first player, each player must choose two dice and put them in front of them. Players will do this twice.

After all dice are spoken for, players take their selected cubes and must place it on a matching square on a card in front of them (Player squares are wild).
If they cannot, they must pick an animal to overfed. Flip that card over, and place the cube on top. 

After this occurs, players have the option to back out and score right then, or continue on. Repeat.

After all players have failed or backed out, repeat Round Setup

## Scoring

When a player scores, add all points from creatures that are fully fed, and subtract 1 for each animal that was undernourished, 3 for each animal that was overfed, 5 for any animal that was not fed at all.
