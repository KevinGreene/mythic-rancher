# Rules

## Object

The object of the game is to be the first person to 30 points

## Game Setup

Each player takes a Player Card (currently not made, just have an area for 5 cubes of any color in front of you).

## Round Setup

At the beginning of each round, shuffle the deck and turn over 3X cards, where x is the number of players.

Choose a starting player.

Players then go around clockwise, selecting one of the cards to have for the next round. This happens until all cards are gone.

## Turns

The starting player rolls 4 colored dice. Each player takes the colors that come up, and places it on their cards including the player card with 5 wilds. If they cannot, they must pick an animal to overfed. Flip that card over, and place the cube on top. 

After this occurs, players have the option to back out and score right then, or continue on. Repeat.

After all players have failed or backed out, repeat Round Setup

## Scoring

When a player scores, add all points from animals that are fully fed, and subtract 1 for each animal that was undernourished, 3 for each animal that was overfed, 5 for any animal that was not fed at all.
