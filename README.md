# Rules

## Object

The object of the game is to be the first person to 30 points

## Game Setup

Each player takes a Player Card (currently not made, just have an area for 5 cubes of any color in front of you).

## Round Setup

At the beginning of each round, shuffle the deck and turn over 4x cards, where x is the number of players.

Choose a starting player.

Players then go around clockwise, selecting one of the cards to have for the next round. This happens until all cards are gone.

## Turns

The starting player rolls 4 colored dice. Each player takes the colors that come up, and places it on their cards including the player card with 5 wilds. If they cannot, they are out for this round, and receive 0 points.

After this occurs, players have the option to back out and score right then, or continue on. Repeat.

After all players have failed or backed out, repeat Round Setup
